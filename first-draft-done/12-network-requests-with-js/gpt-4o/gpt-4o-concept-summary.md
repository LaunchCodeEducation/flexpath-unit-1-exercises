### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in the Transcript

The transcript discusses various JavaScript concepts related to making HTTP requests and handling asynchronous operations. Here are the key concepts:

1. **HTTP Requests**:
    
    - Fundamentals of HTTP requests, including methods (GET, POST) and status codes (200, 404, 500).
    - Understanding HTTP headers and how to set them.
    - Content negotiation using headers like `Content-Type` and `Accept`.
2. **Fetch API**:
    
    - Making HTTP requests using the Fetch API.
    - Handling JSON and text responses.
    - Using promise-based APIs to handle asynchronous requests.
    - Configuring Fetch with options like method, headers, and body.
    - Using `JSON.stringify` to send data as JSON.
3. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Using `try-catch` blocks to handle errors thrown by Fetch.
    - Checking HTTP status codes to handle client and server errors.
    - Handling malformed data and ensuring robust error handling mechanisms.
4. **AbortController**:
    
    - Using `AbortController` to cancel long-running HTTP requests.
    - Understanding how signals work to abort Fetch requests.
5. **ReadableStream and Data Streaming**:
    
    - Using `ReadableStream` to handle large data streams.
    - Tracking download progress and updating the UI accordingly.
6. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**:
    
    - Understanding CORS and the restrictions it imposes.
    - Configuring servers to handle CORS requests.
    - Preflight requests for methods like POST and handling OPTIONS requests.
7. **Session Management and UI Updates**:
    
    - Interacting with the DOM to update UI elements based on HTTP responses.
    - Handling shopping cart functionality and updating session data.
8. **Using External Libraries**:
    
    - Mention of using libraries like Axios for making HTTP requests.
