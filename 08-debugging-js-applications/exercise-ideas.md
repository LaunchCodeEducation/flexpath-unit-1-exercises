### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in the Transcript

The transcript focuses on key concepts related to debugging JavaScript applications, including:

1. **Debugging Basics**:
    
    - Understanding what debugging is and its importance.
    - Differentiating between small bugs and critical issues.
    - The significance of documentation, unit testing, and organized code.
2. **Debugging Tools**:
    
    - Using Visual Studio Code for debugging backend Node.js applications.
    - Using Chrome DevTools to debug frontend JavaScript code.
    - Setting up VS Code and Chrome DevTools for debugging.
3. **Breakpoints and Step Execution**:
    
    - Setting breakpoints to pause code execution and inspect variables.
    - Using step over, step into, and step out to navigate through code.
    - Understanding conditional breakpoints for more targeted debugging.
4. **Expressions and Exceptions**:
    
    - Watching expressions to monitor variable values.
    - Handling exceptions to prevent code crashes.
5. **Stack Traces**:
    
    - Reading stack traces to trace the error path.
    - Understanding how stack traces help identify where errors occur.
6. **Logpoints and Auto Attach**:
    
    - Using logpoints to log messages without altering code.
    - Setting up auto attach in VS Code to automatically debug Node.js processes.
7. **Performance and Memory Debugging**:
    
    - Using Chrome DevTools to analyze performance issues.
    - Identifying memory leaks and understanding garbage collection.
    - Taking heap snapshots to inspect memory usage.
8. **Network Debugging**:
    
    - Using the Network panel in Chrome DevTools to inspect API requests.
    - Diagnosing failed requests and understanding HTTP status codes.

### 20 Coding Exercise Ideas

1. **Write a function that simulates a bug and use `console.log` to debug it.**
2. **Set a breakpoint in a simple JavaScript function and step through the code using VS Code.**
3. **Create a function that throws an error, and use try-catch to handle the exception.**
4. **Write code that uses a conditional breakpoint to pause execution when a variable reaches a specific value.**
5. **Create a simple Node.js app and use VS Codeâ€™s debugger to inspect variables in the global and local scope.**
6. **Implement a function that intentionally causes a stack overflow and use a stack trace to debug it.**
7. **Write code that uses `setTimeout` and use breakpoints to understand the asynchronous behavior.**
8. **Use Chrome DevTools to inspect the HTML of a web page and fix a broken CSS rule.**
9. **Simulate a memory leak in JavaScript and use the Chrome DevTools Memory panel to identify it.**
10. **Create an API call that fails, and use the Chrome DevTools Network tab to debug the error.**
