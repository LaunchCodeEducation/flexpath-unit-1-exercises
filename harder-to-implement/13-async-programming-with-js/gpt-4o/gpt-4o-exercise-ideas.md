### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in the Transcript

The transcript for the course on JavaScript covers a range of topics related to asynchronous programming, specifically focusing on Promises, async/await, and handling HTTP requests. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the concepts discussed:

1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
    
    - Understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous code execution.
    - Working with callbacks and the challenges they present, such as the callback pyramid of doom.
2. **Promises**:
    
    - Creating and using Promises in JavaScript.
    - Promise states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
    - Consuming promises using `then`, `catch`, and `finally` methods.
    - Chaining multiple promises for sequential execution.
    - Handling errors and understanding how promises handle rejected states.
    - Using Promise-based libraries like Axios.
3. **Async/Await**:
    
    - Simplifying asynchronous code using the `async` and `await` keywords.
    - Error handling in async functions using try-catch blocks.
    - Using async/await for sequential and parallel API requests.
    - Combining promises and async/await for more complex asynchronous flows.
4. **Advanced Promise Methods**:
    
    - `Promise.all`: Running multiple promises concurrently and waiting for all to complete.
    - `Promise.allSettled`: Handling all promises and capturing both resolved and rejected outcomes.
    - `Promise.any`: Returning the first resolved promise and handling multiple sources of data.
    - `Promise.race`: Handling the first settled promise, whether fulfilled or rejected.
5. **HTTP Requests**:
    
    - Making HTTP requests using `XMLHttpRequest` and Fetch API.
    - Handling and configuring HTTP headers and status codes.
    - Using AbortController to cancel requests.
    - Understanding CORS and preflight requests.

### 20 JavaScript Coding Exercise Ideas

1. **Write a function that uses the Fetch API to make a simple GET request and log the response.**
2. **Create a function that makes a POST request using Fetch, sending data as JSON, and handles the response.**
3. **Use `XMLHttpRequest` to make a GET request and handle both success and error cases.**
4. **Create a custom Promise that resolves after 2 seconds and use it in an async function.**
5. **Write code to handle multiple API calls using `Promise.all` and log the combined results.**
6. **Implement error handling in an async function using try-catch to catch any API errors.**
7. **Use `Promise.race` to manage a slow API call with a timeout Promise and handle whichever finishes first.**
8. **Create a function that uses `Promise.any` to return the first successful result from multiple API endpoints.**
9. **Write a function that uses `AbortController` to cancel a Fetch request if it takes too long.**
10. **Create a retry mechanism for a failed API call using async/await and retrying up to 3 times.**
11. **Write code to demonstrate the use of `Promise.allSettled` and log both resolved and rejected outcomes.**
12. **Create a function that fetches data and uses `finally` to perform cleanup actions regardless of success or failure.**
13. **Build a simple loading spinner that shows while data is being fetched and hides when the fetch completes.**
14. **Write an async function that fetches data from an API and processes it in a specific order.**
15. **Implement a function that makes parallel API requests using async/await and displays results as they come in.**
16. **Use the Fetch API to make a request and handle different HTTP status codes with appropriate messages.**
17. **Create a function that uses a callback to fetch data and then refactor it using Promises.**
18. **Write code that simulates a network request and demonstrates the use of `finally` in both success and failure cases.**
19. **Build a function that uses async/await to fetch multiple pieces of data concurrently and logs the results.**
20. **Create a function that handles CORS errors gracefully and logs a custom error message for the user.**
