### Summary of React Concepts Covered in the Transcript

The course covers a wide array of important concepts for building React applications, especially focusing on state management and routing. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **React Components**:
    
    - Building functional components.
    - Using JSX to describe the UI structure.
2. **React State Management**:
    
    - Managing state with `useState`.
    - Handling derived state.
    - Using `useEffect` for side effects, such as fetching data.
    - Custom hooks to streamline code.
    - Error boundaries for catching and displaying errors gracefully.
3. **Routing with React Router**:
    
    - Setting up routing using `react-router-dom`.
    - Declaring routes with `Route` and using `Link` for navigation.
    - Using URL parameters with `useParams`.
    - Handling 404 pages with custom components.
    - Using `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation.
4. **Event Handling**:
    
    - Handling events such as form submissions and button clicks.
    - Using React's synthetic event system for consistent event handling.
5. **Fetching Data and Error Handling**:
    
    - Fetching data using async/await and promises.
    - Handling loading states and errors effectively.
    - Using a mock API to simulate real-world data fetching.
6. **Performance Optimization**:
    
    - Using hooks like `useCallback` and `useMemo` for optimization.
    - Techniques to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
7. **Custom Hooks**:
    
    - Creating and using custom hooks to simplify repetitive logic.
    - Centralizing data-fetching logic.

### 20 React Coding Exercise Ideas

1. **Build a functional component that displays a list of items passed as props and uses `useState` to toggle a loading spinner.**
2. **Create a custom hook `useFetch` that fetches data from an API and handles loading and error states.**
3. **Implement a counter component using `useState` with increment, decrement, and reset buttons.**
4. **Create a form component that uses controlled inputs and validates the input data.**
5. **Use `useEffect` to fetch data from a mock API when a component mounts and display the data.**
6. **Build a component that filters a list of products based on a category selected from a dropdown menu.**
7. **Create a multi-step form using local state to manage the current step and form data.**
8. **Use `useContext` to manage and share a theme state (light/dark mode) across multiple components.**
9. **Write a higher-order component (HOC) that adds a logging feature to any wrapped component.**
10. **Implement a component that displays an error boundary and shows a fallback UI if an error occurs.**
11. **Create a product detail page that fetches data based on a URL parameter using `useParams`.**
12. **Build a shopping cart feature using `useReducer` to handle complex state logic for adding and removing items.**
13. **Use React Router to set up multiple pages, including a home page, product page, and 404 error page.**
14. **Implement a button that navigates to a different route using `useNavigate` when clicked.**
15. **Build a tabbed interface where each tab displays different content using React state.**
16. **Create a component that uses `useRef` to focus an input field when the component mounts.**
17. **Write a function that memoizes a computation using `useMemo` and explain when it should be used.**
18. **Use `useCallback` to memoize a function and prevent unnecessary re-renders in a child component.**
19. **Create a component that fetches and displays user data, with the ability to refresh the data manually.**
20. **Build a simple CRUD app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete items, using local state to manage the data.**
