25 JavaScript Coding Exercises
Here are exercises covering these concepts:

Syntax & Semicolons: Write a simple JavaScript program to print "Hello, World!" to the console. Use semicolons appropriately.

Keywords: Declare variables using let, const, and var and explain the difference between them.

Operators: Write a script that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers and logs the results.

Comments: Add both single-line and multi-line comments in a script explaining what each line does.

Variables: Declare a variable to hold your age, name, and city of residence using camel case.

Dynamic Typing: Write a script that changes a variable's data type multiple times and logs the typeof each time.

Boolean Values: Create a variable with a Boolean value and toggle it using the ! (not) operator.

String Properties & Methods: Use a string and experiment with toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), and finding its length.

Template Literals: Create a script that logs a personalized greeting using template literals.

Number Limits: Display the minimum and maximum safe integers in JavaScript.

BigInt: Create a script that defines a BigInt and demonstrates operations with very large numbers.

e-notation: Write a script using e-notation to represent very large and very small numbers.

Null vs. Undefined: Declare a variable without assigning it and log it. Then, assign null to another variable and log it. Use typeof on both.

Creating Objects: Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and publishedYear.

Accessing Object Properties: Use dot and bracket notation to access properties from an object.

Modifying Objects: Change the publishedYear of your book object and add a new property for genre.

Delete Object Properties: Delete a property from an object and log the updated object.

Pass by Reference: Demonstrate how modifying an object in one variable affects another variable that references the same object.

Garbage Collection: Write a short explanation and create an example illustrating garbage collection in action.

Date Object: Create a new Date object and log the current date and time.

Date Methods: Extract the year, month, and day from the current date using the Date object methods.

Custom Dates: Create a Date object for your birthday and format it as a readable string.

Date Arithmetic: Calculate the number of days between today and another date using JavaScript.

String Concatenation: Concatenate two strings using both + operator and template literals, and compare the output.

Include Method: Write a script that checks if a string includes a particular substring and logs the result.
