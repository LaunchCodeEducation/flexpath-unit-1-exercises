Exercise 1: Understanding Debugging Importance

Description: Explain why debugging is a crucial part of software development. Provide an example of how a small bug can lead to significant issues if not addressed promptly.
Answer:

Debugging is essential because it helps developers find and fix errors that can cause a program to behave unexpectedly or crash. 
Small bugs, such as an off-by-one error in a loop, can lead to significant issues like incorrect calculations, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.



*/

// Off-by-one error in array iteration
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

// Incorrect loop (i <= numbers.length)
for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) {
  sum += numbers[i]; // Accesses undefined when i = numbers.length
}

console.log(sum); // NaN (Not a Number)

// This small bug causes the program to sum undefined, resulting in an incorrect total.

/*

Exercise 2: Differentiating Bugs and Critical Issues

Description: Define the difference between a minor bug and a critical issue in software development. Give an example of each in JavaScript code.
Answer:

Minor Bug: A small error that doesn't significantly affect the program's functionality but might cause unexpected behavior in certain cases.


*/

// minor bug issue
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name.toUppercase()); // Typo in method name
}

greet("Alice"); // TypeError: name.toUppercase is not a function

/*
Critical Issue: A significant error that causes the program to crash, produce incorrect results, or expose security vulnerabilities.

*/

// critical issue example
function authenticate(userInput) {
  if (userInput.password == storedPassword) {
    // Authentication logic
  }
}

// Using '==' instead of '===' can lead to security issues
// Using == instead of === can allow type coercion, potentially bypassing authentication.

/*
Exercise 3: Importance of Documentation and Unit Testing

Description: Discuss how documentation and unit testing contribute to easier debugging and overall code quality. 
Provide an example of a simple unit test in JavaScript using Jest.
Answer:

Documentation helps developers understand code functionality, making it easier to locate and fix bugs. 
Unit testing ensures individual components work as expected, catching bugs early in the development process.


*/

// Example Unit Test:
// sum.js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = sum;

// sum.test.js
const sum = require("./sum");

test("adds 2 + 3 to equal 5", () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});

// Running this test can quickly identify issues in the sum function.

/*

*/

/*

Exercise 7: Using Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out

Description: Explain the difference between "Step Over", "Step Into", and "Step Out" during debugging. Provide an example of when to use each.
Answer:

* Step Over (F10): Executes the current line of code and moves to the next line without entering any called functions.

	Use When: You want to execute function calls without debugging inside them.

* Step Into (F11): Enters into the called function to debug its code line by line.

	Use When: You need to inspect the internal workings of a function.

* Step Out (Shift+F11): Executes the rest of the current function and returns to the caller.

	Use When: You're inside a function and want to finish it quickly.


*/

// example
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function calculateArea(length, width) {
  return multiply(length, width);
}

const area = calculateArea(5, 10);

/*
* Step Into calculateArea to debug multiply.
* Step Over multiply if you trust it works and only want to debug calculateArea.
* Step Out of multiply if you entered it but now want to return to calculateArea.

*/

/*

Exercise 8: Setting Conditional Breakpoints

Description: Demonstrate how to set a conditional breakpoint that only pauses execution when a variable meets a certain condition. Use a loop as an example.

*/
