### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in the Transcript

The transcript discusses various JavaScript concepts related to making HTTP requests and handling asynchronous operations. Here are the key concepts:

1. **HTTP Requests**:
    
    - Fundamentals of HTTP requests, including methods (GET, POST) and status codes (200, 404, 500).
    - Understanding HTTP headers and how to set them.
    - Content negotiation using headers like `Content-Type` and `Accept`.
2. **Fetch API**:
    
    - Making HTTP requests using the Fetch API.
    - Handling JSON and text responses.
    - Using promise-based APIs to handle asynchronous requests.
    - Configuring Fetch with options like method, headers, and body.
    - Using `JSON.stringify` to send data as JSON.
3. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Using `try-catch` blocks to handle errors thrown by Fetch.
    - Checking HTTP status codes to handle client and server errors.
    - Handling malformed data and ensuring robust error handling mechanisms.
4. **AbortController**:
    
    - Using `AbortController` to cancel long-running HTTP requests.
    - Understanding how signals work to abort Fetch requests.
5. **ReadableStream and Data Streaming**:
    
    - Using `ReadableStream` to handle large data streams.
    - Tracking download progress and updating the UI accordingly.
6. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**:
    
    - Understanding CORS and the restrictions it imposes.
    - Configuring servers to handle CORS requests.
    - Preflight requests for methods like POST and handling OPTIONS requests.
7. **Session Management and UI Updates**:
    
    - Interacting with the DOM to update UI elements based on HTTP responses.
    - Handling shopping cart functionality and updating session data.
8. **Using External Libraries**:
    
    - Mention of using libraries like Axios for making HTTP requests.

### 20 JavaScript Coding Exercise Ideas

1. **Write a function to make a simple GET request using the Fetch API and log the JSON response.**
2. **Create a function that makes a POST request using Fetch and sends data as JSON.**
3. **Implement error handling in a Fetch call using a `try-catch` block and log an error message.**
4. **Write a function to check the HTTP status code of a response and display a custom message for 404 errors.**
5. **Use the Fetch API to request data from an API and display a loading spinner until the data is loaded.**
6. **Create a function that uses `AbortController` to cancel a Fetch request if it takes too long.**
7. **Build a function to fetch an image from a URL and display it, handling cases where the image cannot be loaded.**
8. **Write a function that makes multiple Fetch requests in parallel using `Promise.all` and logs all responses.**
9. **Implement a function to send custom headers in a Fetch request and log the headers on the server.**
10. **Create a function to handle a CORS error and display an appropriate message to the user.**
11. **Write a function that uses `ReadableStream` to track the download progress of a large file.**
12. **Build a shopping cart feature that updates the item count when an item is added using Fetch.**
13. **Create a function that retries a failed Fetch request up to three times before giving up.**
14. **Write a function that makes a preflight CORS request and handles the server’s response.**
15. **Implement a feature that uses the Fetch API to send form data and handles the server’s response.**
16. **Create a function that uses `Promise.race` to handle a slow API call with a timeout.**
17. **Write a function that logs the response headers of an HTTP request, including `Content-Length`.**
18. **Build a progress bar that updates as data is received using `ReadableStream` and Fetch.**
19. **Use Axios to make a GET request and compare its syntax and ease of use to Fetch.**
20. **Write a function to fetch data from a brittle API that randomly fails and handle it gracefully.**
